### Overview
The goal of the podcast program is to offer developers digital content that is  – educational, fun, digestible, technical, and industry focused. This will be a 30 - 60  minute long discussion with hackers, thought leaders & innovators of open source software about CI/CD emerging practices, industry trends, tips, and important/hot topics. This will be published on a weekly cadence.    
### What is the CDF’s podcast about? 
* Emerging & best practices in the open source software space, specifically in the CD and DevOps industry
* Updates on the CDF’s open source graduated & incubating projects: Screwdriver, Spinnaker, Jenkins, JenkinsX, & Tekton
* Interview industry experts, leaders, and innovators about industry trends, hot topics, emerging practices, best practices, and other insights 
### Podcast Calendar
* The podcast calendar is available for a 60 rolling day period. 
To choose a podcast date, go to the podcast calendar to view the available recording dates. Choose your preferred date. You will receive a calendar invite automatically via Calendly. The calendar invite will be updated with the company / project name, which confirms your podcast. When it gets closer to the podcast date, an email is sent confirming the podcast date is still good for you and outlines the next steps.
### How to pick a topic
* The purpose of the podcasts is to educate the community and align your business with important thought-leadership topics.
* The audience is interested in technical demos that help them solve problems and want to be able to ask your expert questions.
* Our audience spans from developers, architects, CIOs, and CTOs. Topics should be tailored for which of those audiences you're trying to target.
* We are emphasizing SEO optimization this year to drive more registrations and views after the fact, so please take some extra time to make sure your abstract is highlighting important keywords. We'll be making suggestions as well.
